## A simple react app that uses Facebook login to access a page

This application uses the library "react-facebook-login" from https://github.com/keppelen/react-facebook-login and this is intended just as a POC. However, this can be configured with "pills" to make this work with LocalStorage, Cookies and RxJS. By now, this is just for demonstration purposes. 

TBD:
I will create a further example in another repository using the mentioned 3 tools above for different scenarios.

## This app is powered by create-react-app 

## Running steps

If you don't have Node Version Manager (nvm) installed, please install it first before continuing.

Once you have nvm, follow next steps: 
### nvm use 

### Run `yarn start`

### Go to https://localhost:3000
